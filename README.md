<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project!
![e-commerce-snippet](https://github.com/Willi0t/ecommerce-front/assets/113394429/33ca9fba-046e-4be2-b3a0-985abffa6bce)


This e-commerce project consists of two separate applications: [E-commerce Front](https://github.com/Willi0t/ecommerce-front) and [E-commerce Admin](https://github.com/Willi0t/ecommerce-admin). The store offers a simplified tech shop experience, featuring a variety of merchandise including phones, tablets, and laptops. The front end of the store is built using Next.js and showcases products with a user-friendly interface, utilizing Styled Components to demonstrate different styling approaches. The store includes a fully functional payment system powered by Stripe, ensuring secure and seamless transactions.

When testing the payment and order system, use a card number, such as 4242 4242 4242 4242. Enter the card number in the Dashboard or in any payment form.

- Use a valid future date, such as 12/34.
- Use any three-digit CVC (four digits for American Express cards).
- Use any value you like for other form fields.

The [E-commerce Admin](https://github.com/Willi0t/ecommerce-admin) application, also built with Next.js, provides a comprehensive admin panel for managing the store's inventory and processing orders. It allows administrators to easily add, update, and remove products, as well as handle customer orders efficiently. This dual-application setup ensures a smooth and efficient experience for both customers and store managers. You can explore the admin panel project in more detail [here](https://github.com/Willi0t/ecommerce-admin).

I chose Next.js for this project because it’s a powerful framework for React that brings a lot to the table. First off, it offers server-side rendering and static site generation, which means our web pages load faster and perform better in search engine rankings.Additionally, Next.js simplifies complex tasks like routing and API handling

</a>

For handling payments, I went with Stripe. It’s known for its security and reliability, which is essential for managing transactions. Integrating Stripe is straightforward thanks to its well-documented API. It supports a wide range of payment methods and currencies, making it versatile for different users. Whether we’re dealing with small or large transactions, Stripe scales effortlessly, ensuring we can handle any volume of payments smoothly.

</a>

When it came to choosing a database, MongoDB was the clear choice. Its schema-less design means we can iterate quickly and adapt our data model as needed without a lot of hassle. MongoDB excels at handling large amounts of data and traffic, which is great for scalability. It’s also very developer-friendly, with simple queries and efficient data retrieval. This means we can focus more on building features rather than managing database constraints.

</a>

For styling, I opted for Styled Components. This library lets us write CSS directly within our JavaScript, making it easy to scope styles to individual components. This approach keeps our styling modular and reusable, which is great for maintaining the codebase. Styled Components also support theming and dynamic styling, allowing us to create a more cohesive and adaptable design system. The developer experience is fantastic too, with features like auto-completion and syntax highlighting in modern IDEs.
